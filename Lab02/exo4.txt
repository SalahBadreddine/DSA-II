1/. All algorithms generate only legal permutations because they don't allow for replicates, which means that each algorith
check if the random value that is going to be assigned to A[i] is already used, but each algorithm implements it
in a different way ! 
All the permuations are equally likely to be generated because all the algorithm use the method randInt, thus we can't 
predict the next number

2/. For the first program, the complexity is: O(n2 logn)
For the second program, the complexity is: O(n logn)
For the last program, the complexity is: O(n)

3/.
